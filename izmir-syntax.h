/* About AST data structures and heap-allocation.
 * ************************************************************************** */

/* This headers defines C data types representing a high-level AST data
   structure for a izmir program.

   Unboxed AST data structures are all heap-allocated with malloc .  There is no
   sharing within an AST (no two parents ever point to the same children) and in
   particular every text string is allocated independently, even when the text
   it contains is identical to the text of another string occurring elsewhere in
   the same AST.

   All the allocation, right now, occurs within the parser rules.  There is no
   explicit facility to free ASTs, but that would be trivial to add if needed in
   the future. */
